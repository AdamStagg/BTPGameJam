# Desert Level
## There are 6 desert level files.

## Skybox, Backgorund, Background2, Foreground,  Midground, and Finished Piece.

## Finished Piece is what they should all look like together.

## Background and Background2 are two layers that should have been combined probably, but I left them separate by mistake. It should make no difference! Do as you will with them--lock them together in the parallax or have 4-layer parallax!
