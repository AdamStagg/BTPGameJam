# Initial Graphics are placed here to use in the Unity Project. :)

### All the assets in here are initial versions.

There are three layers of background images for the parallax effect

One bare tree layer (We may not need it except for scenery or something :) )

a tree with leaves layer

and the character layer.

All have transparent backgrounds.

### Feel free to implement the character movement without animation initially. Movement animation will come later.
