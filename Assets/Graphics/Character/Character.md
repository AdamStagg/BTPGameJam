# Character Here

## There are five files
The animated ones are apngs (Animated PNGs). To preview them in their animated form, open them in an internet browser (I used firefox.)
The files are as follows:

## Static
A static, non-animated standing character.
## Running
A running animation.
## Sucking
The animation for staying in one spot and sucking.
## RunningAndSucking
The animation for running and sucking simultaneously.
## ColorSucking
The animation that should play when the character is sucking color out.
